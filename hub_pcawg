# PCAWG Xena hub
####_PANCANCER ANALYSIS OF WHOLE GENOMES datasets_

The Pancancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study is an international collaboration to identify a comprehensive description of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in 2,800 cancer whole genomes in 47 different tumor types from the International Cancer Genome Consortium. 

PCAWG Xena hub hosts primary results from the project
Consensus whole genome SNVs, indels and SVs
Consensus whole genome copy number
RNAseq gene expression, consensus fusion calls, and alternative promoter usage
Small RNA-Seq (miRNA) analyses
Coding patient-centric driver catalogue
Integrated driver calls
Mutation Signatures
Methylation data
Tumour subtype, histology information, donor clinical data
